# Retrosynthetic Accessibility (RA) score
 * RAscore is a score learned from the predictions of a computer aided synthesis planning tool (AiZynthfinder: https://github.com/MolecularAI/aizynthfinder). 
 * **RAscore is intended to be a binary score, indicating whether the underlying computer aided synthesis planning tool can find a route (1) or not (0) to a given compound.** 
 * The tool has been trained on 200,000 compounds from ChEMBL and so is limited to compounds within similar regions of chemical space. It is intended to predict the retrosynthetic accessibility of bioactive molecules. (Data can be found in `data.zip`)
 * Attempts to use the score on more exotic compounds such as those found in the GDB databases will not work: 
    * In this case the model will need to be switched to `GDBscore`, the corresponding models can be found in the models folder or downloaded from the pre-print server.

## Installation 

Follow the steps in the defined order to avoid conflicts.

1. Create an environment (note: the python version must be >=3.7):\
`conda create --name myenv python=3.7`\
`conda activate myenv`

or use an existing environment 

2. Install rdkit 2020.03 (if already installed skip this step)
```
conda install -c rdkit rdkit -y
```

3. Clone the RAscore repository 
`git clone https://github.com/reymond-group/RAscore.git`

change directory to the repository
`cd RAscore`

4. Install RAscore
`python -m pip install -e .`

## Usage
### Importing in Python
Depending on if you would like to use the XGB based or Tensorflow based models you can import different modules. 

To walk through the example in a jupyter notebook refer to `rascore_usage.ipynb`

```
from RAscore import RAscore_NN #For tensorflow and keras based models
from RAscore import RAscore_XGB #For XGB based models

nn_scorer = RAscore_NN.RAScorerNN() 
xgb_scorer = RAscore_XGB.RAScorerXGB()

#Imatinib mesylate
imatinib_mesylate = 'CC1=C(C=C(C=C1)NC(=O)C2=CC=C(C=C2)CN3CCN(CC3)C)NC4=NC=CC(=N4)C5=CN=CC=C5.CS(=O)(=O)O'
nn_scorer.predict(imatinib_mesylate)
0.99522984

xgb_scorer.predict(imatinib_mesylate)
0.99259007

#Omeprazole
omeprazole = 'CC1=CN=C(C(=C1OC)C)CS(=O)C2=NC3=C(N2)C=C(C=C3)OC'
nn_scorer.predict(omeprazole)
0.99999106

xgb_scorer.predict(omeprazole)
0.9556329

#Morphine - Illustrates problem synthesis planning tools face with complex ring systems
morphine = 'CN1CC[C@]23c4c5ccc(O)c4O[C@H]2[C@@H](O)C=C[C@H]3[C@H]1C5'
nn_scorer.predict(morphine)
8.316945e-07

xgb_scorer.predict(morphine)
0.0028359715
```

### Command Line Interface
A command line interface is provided which allows batch processing and enables the flexibility of specifying models.\
```
Usage: RAscore [OPTIONS]

Example: A set of smiles `test.smi` are provided

`RAscore -f test.smi -c SMILES -o test.csv`

Default Model: XGBoost using ChEMBL and ECFP4 counts with features

Options:
  -f, --file_path TEXT      Absolute path to input file containing one SMILES
                            on each line. The column should be labelled
                            "SMILES" or if another header is used, specify it
                            as an option

  -c, --column_header TEXT  The name given to the singular column in the file
                            which contains the SMILES. The column must be
                            named.

  -o, --output_path TEXT    Output file path
  -m, --model_path TEXT     Absolute path to the model to use, if .h5 file
                            neural network in tensorflow/keras, if .pkl then
                            XGBoost

  --help                    Show this message and exit.
```
Further RAscore models are contained in the `RAscore/models/models.zip` folder if you wish to specify a different model than the default:
* RAscore
    * DNN_chembl_fcfp_counts
    * XGB_chembl_ecfp_counts
* GDBscore
    * DNN_gdbchembl_fcfp_counts
    * XGB_gdbchembl_ecfp_counts

## Retraining  
If you want to retrain models, or train your own models using the hyperparameter optimisation framework found in the 'model_building' folder, then the following should be installed in the environemnt aswell:\
`pip install -e .[retraining]`

The SYBA, SCscore and SAscore should also be downloaded for descriptor calculations and training scripts modified to reflect the locations of the models:
* https://github.com/lich-uct/syba
* https://github.com/connorcoley/scscore
* https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/tree/master/Contrib/SA_Score

Please refer to the `model_building` folder for further information about retraining.

## Performance on Test Set
* Test set contains ca. 20,000 compounds from ChEMBL
* The model was able to separate clusters of solved/unsolved compounds as found by computing the average linkage
* RAscore can better differentiate between solved/unsolved compounds than existing methods.
